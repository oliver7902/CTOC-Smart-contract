# CTOC Smart Contract Documentation

## Overview

CTOC is an ERC20 token smart contract with additional features such as pausability, burnable tokens, time-based and vesting-based token locking mechanisms, and role-based access control.

## Contract Inheritance

The CTOC contract inherits from the following contracts:

- `Pausable`: Allows pausing and unpausing of token transfers
- `Ownable`: Provides basic access control mechanism with an owner
- `Supervisable`: Introduces a vesting admin role for specific functions
- `Burnable`: Allows designated addresses to burn tokens
- `Lockable`: Implements time-based and vesting-based token locking
- `ERC20`: Standard implementation of the ERC20 token interface

## Key Features

1. **Pausability**: The contract owner can pause and unpause all token transfers.
2. **Burnable Tokens**: Designated burner addresses can burn their own tokens.
3. **Token Locking**:
  - Time-based locking: Tokens can be locked for a specific time period.
  - Vesting-based locking: Tokens can be locked with a vesting schedule.
4. **Role-Based Access Control**:
  - Owner: Has overall control of the contract.
  - Vesting Admin: Can manage vesting and time locks.
  - Locker: Can add time and vesting locks.
  - Burner: Can burn tokens.

## Initial Supply

The initial supply of CTOC tokens is set to 5,000,000,000 tokens (considering 18 decimals).
